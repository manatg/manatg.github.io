  <h2 class="headings"> What Computer Studies consist of</h2>
  <p>Software and software system creation and testing are the main areas of computer science study. Working with mathematical models, data security and analysis, algorithms, and computational theory are all aspects of it.</p>

  <h2 class= "headings"> The Importance of Computer Studies</h2>
  <p>Computer studies has made it possible to create advanced technologies that can help solve environmental issues. Computers make it simple to address problems like pollution, waste management and disposal, disease detection and containment, and others.</p>

<p><strong>Not only is computer science our future, but it is also our present.</strong> Computer scientists create, construct, and improve supply chains, content algorithms, and even job application systems.  As the economy and every aspect of our life become more dependent on technology, computer science becomes more crucial.</p>
